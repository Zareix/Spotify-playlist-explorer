# Spotify Playlist Explorer
### Author : Raphaël Gonçalves Catarino

This project aims at creating a Spotify playlist explorer in order to discover JavaScript through [React.js](https://fr.reactjs.org/) and request to API (with jQuery and AJAX).<br><br>
To do so I used the [Spotify WEB API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and the npm package [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to create the base of the project.<br>
Project deployed on Heroku (via GitHub deployement) avalaible [here](https://rgc-spotify-playlist-explorer.herokuapp.com/) for testing
