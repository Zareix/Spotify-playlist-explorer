# Spotify Playlist Explorer
###Author : Raphaël Gonçalves Catarino

This project aims at creating a Spotify playlist explorer to discover React.js and request to API
To do so I use [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [creat-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to create the base of the project.
