# Spotify Playlist Explorer

This project aims at creating a Spotify playlist explorer in order to discover [React.js](https://fr.reactjs.org/) and basic HTTP requests to API (with Axios).<br><br>
To do so I used the [Spotify WEB API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).<br>
App avalaible [here](https://spotify-explorer.raphael-catarino.fr) if you want to try it out !
